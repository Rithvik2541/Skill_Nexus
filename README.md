# **Peer-to-Peer Learning Social Platform**

## **Overview**
PS-10 is a **Peer-to-Peer Learning Social Platform** built using **MERN Stack**, integrating **Knowledge Graphs** to recommend learning partners based on skills. The platform allows users to create and join learning groups, interact via personal chat (using WebSockets), and engage through a user-friendly dashboard featuring connections and relevant posts.

## **Key Features**
- **Knowledge Graph-Based Peer Matching**: Uses **graph-based recommendations** to connect learners based on skills and interests.
- **Personal Chat with WebSockets**: Real-time **1:1 messaging** for seamless collaboration.
- **Skill-Based Learning Groups**: Users can create and join **learning communities**.
- **Connection & Post System**: Users can **follow** connections and view **learning-related posts**.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A personalized user interface displaying **connections, discussions, and posts**.
- **User Profile Integration**: Pulls coding profiles and projects from **RapidAPI (e.g., GitHub, LeetCode)** to extract technical skills.
